# CountriesReactRest
Just me trying to learn how to do some things with React by consuming the restcountries web API endpoints.

I basically am just pulling down the data, then sorting and visualizing it different ways(Recharts) based on button presses. Nothing too crazy, but I had fun working on it, since I haven't had much time to do anything with SPAs.
